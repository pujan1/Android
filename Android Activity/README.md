<h2>Android_activity</h2>

Android Deviced depend mainly on activity. 
One view could be imaged as one activity.


Explaination:
- When we first start up the app Activity A loads and other remain closed as there is no need of them to be initiated to save the memory

we can see that the activity 1 oads without other activity even touch.
There is a counter on whenever the activity is loaded the counter increases. 
The total count is one when intitialized and keeps on increasing whenever the activity loads up.
- When Activity 2 is loaded, activity 1 is stopped and the counter of the app is started with 1

- With some more dialogue or activity switching we can raise the counter of the app by 1. Here is an example of activity 1 goes to 3 count when its been initialized 3 times.
